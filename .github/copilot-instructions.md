# Copilot Instructions for AI Agents

## Project Overview
This workspace is a simple Python project for learning and experimentation. The main code is in `premierprojetpython/first.py`, which demonstrates basic Python operations and print statements. There are no complex architectural components, external dependencies, or advanced workflows.

## Key Files and Structure
- `premierprojetpython/first.py`: Main Python script. Contains basic variable assignments, arithmetic, string operations, and print statements.
- No tests, build scripts, or configuration files are present.
- No external libraries or package managers (e.g., requirements.txt, pip, conda) are used.

## Developer Workflow
- To run the project, execute `first.py` directly:
  ```powershell
  python premierprojetpython/first.py
  ```
- No build or test steps are required.
- No debugging configuration is present; use standard Python debugging tools if needed.

## Project-Specific Conventions
- Code style is informal and focused on learning basic Python syntax.
- Variable names are simple and descriptive (e.g., `somme`, `produit`, `st`).
- Statements are separated by semicolons or newlines.
- String operations and indexing are demonstrated (e.g., `print(st[0])`).

## Integration Points
- No integration with external services, APIs, or other components.
- No cross-file or cross-component communication.

## Guidance for AI Agents
- Focus on clear, beginner-friendly Python code.
- Avoid introducing unnecessary complexity or external dependencies.
- When adding new examples, keep them simple and educational.
- Reference `premierprojetpython/first.py` for existing patterns and style.

## Example Patterns
- Arithmetic: `puissance = 2 ** 2`
- String multiplication: `print(3*" oui"+" zero")`
- String indexing: `print(st[0])`

If you need to add more advanced features, ask the user for requirements and confirm before making structural changes.
